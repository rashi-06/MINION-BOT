# Minion-BOT
This is a Discord BOT that is built using discord.js
In this repo , I am using TENO API to send gifs when the bot recieves the command "!gif"
This gifs are costomized , example - Whenever the bot  recieves the command "gif funny" , it sends a funny gif.
The default gif that the bot sends on recieving the command "!gif" is a Mininon Gif.


Also using a  joke API to send joke specifically on programming :)
